            <h2>Welcome to 'Prophet Muhammad - [PBUH] Site'</h2>
			<p>I hail from the Silicon Valley of India, Bengaluru and born to Hazrath Syed Abdul Kareem and
Bibi Meharun Nisa , who belonged to the noble profession of Pedagogy . I obtained a Post Graduate
degree in Physics and served in many colleges as lecturer and later as visiting professor. I am a life
member of the Indian Association of Physics Teachers and spent 63 years of my life.
</p>

			<p>
“The JHS Institutions” is our brain child. I am the Chairman and my spouse
Mrs. Syeda Shahwar Banu is an Awardee and Founder Principal of this pet establishment since
1979 . </p>

<p>
 The desire to take up research made me to become the life member and Fellow of United
Writers' Association of India in the year 1988 and completed my research on the subject 'Soluble
models for the development of 3D technology '. I was awarded Ph.D in theoretical physics from
The International University, California, USA in the year 1992.

</p>
<p>


I have authored many publications on physics, which includes the most famous 'Physics
made simple' series first published in 2007 and saw a number of revised editions. I have
authored many couplets and poems in different languages, essays on Creator, Creation,
Universe etc. 
</p>
<p>
My observation on the master plan and construction of Holy Kaaba , built by angels on the
elevated land at the time of creation and the study about Vastu and FengShui are found to be
indistinguishable , even though it happened 4.54 billion years ago . Further, my passion for
mathematics leads me to study the Arabic Numerology (Abjad). 
</p>
<p>
The teaching of Physics and in particular the Universe for three long decades and the
spiritual knowledge from Noble Quran that “Universe is created from Smoke
“[ Sura 41and Verse 11 ] , motivated to think about the Universal Medium . And I was successful in
proving that “Radiance is the Universal Medium and it belongs to Prophet Muhammad[ PBUH ]”
Consequently the Speed of Radiance replaces the Velocity of  Light in many equations derived since centuries, including the Einstein's equation e = m c 2.

</p>
<p>

Even after 1400 years, different books have different date of birth of Prophet Muhammad
[PBUH] and in particular the year as 570 and 571 CE. Mankind has progressed in all walks of life
yet, failed to find the exact dates of the previous centuries. The lineage and affinity towards
Prophet [PBUH] motivated to formulate a calendar of the period of their lifetime. Consequently I
formulated a calendar of the past, present and future centuries and named as 

<strong>WORLD ETERNAL CALENDAR or AMEEN CALENDAR.</strong>
</p>
<p>
It is a known fact that Prophet [PBUH] was born and secluded on Monday and lived for 63
years in this world. The study of many 63 years has proved that “There will be 22331 days in
any 63 years between the same days “. Consequently I made a law , which states that “ IN ANY
63 LUNAR YEARS AND BETWEEN THE SAME DAYS , THERE MUST BE 22331 DAYS “
 and named as AMEEN'S LAW . 

</p>
<p>
The application of calendar and the law has proved the date of birth as Monday the 22 nd
April 571 CE

</p>
<p>I have authored the Numeric Biographies of Syedina Imam Ali ( R ) , Lady Fathima Zahra (
R ) , Imam Hassan ( R) and Imam Hussain ( R ). I have also authored the Numeric Biographies
of Holy Saints - Ghous e Pak ( R ) , Khwaja Gareeb Nawaz ( R ) , Khwaja Nizamuddin Auliya ( R
) and Khwaja Bande Nawaz and found out their exact DATES of birth as well as DAYS of birth 
</p>
<p>
My research on their DAYS OF BIRTH has confirmed the DIVINE FACT that , ONLY
prophet Muhammad (P) was born on MONDAY , where as all Saints / Messengers / Prophets ,
from Adam (A) to Jesus (A) have born on FRIDAY , including the ten important events that took place in the lifetime of Prophet (P)
</p>
<p>
During the process of making the calendar, all the calendars got stored in my memory and I
am capable of PREDICTING the day of any given date that one can imagine from time immemorial
to eternity. 

</p>
<p>
 I strongly feel, life is a sojourn for constant quest and explorations for truth in materialistic
and non-materialistic worlds. I hope to live up to it (GOD willing).
