	<p></p>


	<p>
		<strong>DATE OF SECLUSION: 16. 03. 11 H: MONDAY</strong>
		</p><p>The corresponding solar dates of all these events were not available, as the present Gregorian
calendar came into existence since 1582 CE. Earlier Julian calendar was existing and it was
discarded due to its discrepancies. The calendar of previous centuries does not exist and even the
present day Internet fails to provide the same.
</p>
	<p></p>




	<p>
		
		</p><p>In this context, a research was taken up, and formulated a calendar which shows the exact
dates from 01. 01. 001 CE till date and extended till infinity, for which even the Internet bears
testimony. As a sequel, the exact dates from 01. 01. 001 BCE to Time Immemorial was formulated.
Thus creating a calendar which shows the exact dates from “ TIME IMMEMORIAL TO INFINITY ”
and named as <strong>“ WORLD ETERNAL CALENDAR ” or “ AMEEN CALENDAR ”. </strong></p>
	<p></p>



		<p>The authenticity and collateral proof of this calendar is evident from contemporary
Mathematician Steve Dinh from America, who has proved 01. 01. 001 CE as Monday by
mathematical calculations, which is available on the link
http:/www.searchfor/ancestors/utility/dayofweek-html. The newly formulated calendar
bears testimony with his calculations. It also bears testimony with the number of days
between 01. 01. 001 CE and 31. 12. 2015 CE as 7, 35,963.
All the lunar dates of the above known important events are successfully incorporated on this
calendar and obtained their corresponding solar dates. </p>

</p>




	<p>
	It is to be observed here that – [1] All the known days and dates of the lunar calendar matched
exactly with the days of the solar calendar, substantiating its authenticity and [2] All the events
took place on a particular day FRIDAY. It is a well known fact that birth, death, entering and
removal of Adam [A.S] from heavens, birth days of Prophets, Rasools and Saints took place on the
same day. And even the Doomsday will take place on FRIDAY – Insha ALLAH.

	</p>


	<p>
A date of birth has day, date, month and year. As regards the Day of Birth of Prophet [PBUH] , He
Himself had told the companions that “I observe fasting on Mondays as I was born on that day “.
The month should be Rabi I, as it is known that, Prophet [PBUH] lived for just 63 years. The date
and year can be confirmed by Ameen's Law, which states that;
	</p>




	<p>
		<strong>“IN ANY 63 LUNAR YEARS AND BETWEEN THE SAME DAYS,
THERE MUST BE 22331 DAYS” </strong>
	
	</p>


	<p>
	Counting 22331 da th ys from the day of Seclusion on Monday the 11 June 632 CE backwards, it was
found out to be Monday the 12 Rabi I 53 BH. And the corresponding solar dates were found out to
be 16 th Rabi th I 11 H and 12 Rabi I 53 BH respectively. In view of the successful incorporation of
the lunar dates of all the known events on the solar calendar as well as its perfect match with the
days of the solar calendar and 22331 days between the birth and seclusion, it can be concluded
nd that Prophet [PBUH] was born on Monday the 22 April 571 CE. 
	</p>




	<p>
		</p><h2>DATE OF BIRTH : <br> 12. 03. 53 BH: 22. 04. 571 CE: MONDAY</h2>
	<p></p>


	<p>
		
		</p><p>Prophet [PBUH] spent a life of 63 years and 4 days [lunar] / 61 years 1 month and 19 days [solar] /
22331 days, in this world. The Arabic Numerology [Abjad] also bears testimony with this Date of
Birth of Prophet Muhammad [PBUH]. </p>
