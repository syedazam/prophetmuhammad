            <h2>Muhammad - THE SUPREME OF CREATION - PBUH</h2>
			<p> ALLAH ( S.W.T ) created the very first creation – the sacred soul of Muhammad (PBUH) Billions
of years ago from THEIR own NOOR and Muhammad (P) worshipped ALLAH (S) and ALLAH (S)
sends Darood to THEIR QALEEL all the time . Then the angels were created to worship ALLAH (S)
and send Darood to THEIR Beloved . Later Adam (A.S), Hawwa (A.S ) , Jin , devil , heaven and hell
were created . The universe was created circa 13.8 Million years ago and solar system came into
existence circa 4.54 Million years ago . The day when Adam (A) and Hawwa (A) obeyed the devil ,
they were removed from heavens and sent to the earth along with Jin and devil circa 5202 BH ,
thus establishing mankind on earth . Over a period of time , devil proved his presence and
mankind was deviated from the right path , 313 Apostles (Rasules) and 1,24,000 Prophets
( Anbiya ) were sent over a period of 5,000 years to guide mankind</p>

			<p>
			In 53 BH , ALLAH (S) created – THE AAQIR - THE LAST (P) , from the Body of Adam (s) and 
Muhammad (P) were born on 12th Rabi I in the year of Elephant as the last Prophet . Though
Muhammad (P) is Apostle and prophet , but is the SUPREME in both the worlds – heavens and
universe . In Urdu , it is rightfully referred as Sarkar e do Jahan . The new generation should not
get confused with the title of Prophet , though a Prophet , but with a vast difference with the other
Rasules or Prophets . The other Apostles and Prophets are ONLY Apostles and Prophets whereas ,
Muhammad (P) is EVERYTHING after ALLAH (S) .
</p>

<p>
In fact ALLAH (S) created
</p><ul>
	<li>
		Everything by Muhammad (P)

	</li>
	<li>
		Everything to Muhammad (P)

	</li>
	<li>
		Everything for Muhammad (P)
	</li>
	
	
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
And further says 
<br>
<strong>“ Whoever obeys Muhammad (P) is like obeying ME (S) ”</strong>
</p>
<p>

When Muhammad (P) is everything , even followers of Muhammad (P) are highly privileged and
holds a special status and will be given salvation earlier to all the followers of other Prophets on
the day of Judgment - Insha ALLAH

</p>
<p>
All praise be to ALLAH (S) , exalted blessings as well as complete peace be on our Prophet (P) on whom ALLAH (S) sends Darood all the time , and their family and companions .
</p>
<p>
It is a well known fact that , ALLAH (S) possess ' NOOR ' (Light) . During Meraj (Ascension) , 
Prophet (P) visited all the seven heavens on Burraq , Raf Raf (Green throne) and a ' Circle of NOOR '
that took to Qaba Qosain ( The uppermost horizon) passing all the 70,000 curtains of NOOR and
met ALLAH (S) . Secondly when Musa (A.S) Pestered ALLAH (S) to show THEIR NOOR , a fraction
of it was shown and the consequence – Burnt Mountain SINAI at Egypt is preserved by ALLAH (S)
till the Dooms Day – Insha ALLAH .

of it was shown and the consequence – Burnt Mountain SINAI at Egypt is preserved by ALLAH (S)
till the Dooms Day – Insha ALLAH .
</p>

<p>
When ALLAH (S) thought of Creation , THEY started with the creation of THEIR BELOVED –
AHMED , QALEEL , HABEEB , SOLLAM , AMEEN , AWWAL (The First) (P) from THEIR own NOOR
without a body or form and Prophet worshipped for Billions of years . The angels were created
from the NOOR of Prophet to worship ALLAH (S) and to send Darood to THEIR beloved . ALLAH
(S) created the body of Adam (A) from the clay on which Prophet was worshipping and the NOOR
of Prophet was infused . Subsequently heaven , hell and Jin were created from the heat of Prophet .
Jin and Devil were created from fire . Adam (A) and Hawwa (A) lived happily in the heavens by
following the instructions and worshipping ALLAH (S) .

</p>

<p>
By the insight of ALLAH (S) , the Universe was created from the Heat associated with the
11 NOOR of Prophet , circa 13.8 Million years ago . The known Universe comprises of Billions (10 )
of Galaxies which are moving away from each other confirming its expansion . Each galaxy has
11 Billions (10 ) of stars and some stars are even bigger than the nearest star – sun . Nuclear
reactions take place in the sun producing Electromagnetic radiations , which comprises of
Radiant Heat Radiations and Light Radiations . The Light radiations or in short light facilitates
visibility , whereas Radiant Heat Radiations or in short Radiance is mandatory for living beings .
This Radiance constitutes a medium on the surface of earth . Similarly the Radiance due to
Billions of stars in Billions of galaxies produces the same Radiance in the entire universe . Since,
the universe itself is created from the heat of Prophet (P), the medium is called as ' MEDIUM OF
PROPHET (P) ', and Radiance is denoted by the symbol ' r ' - the title of Sollam (P) spiritually and
fire scientifically. The Radiance spreads with a constant velocity of 1,86,000 miles per second
unlike light , whose velocity was found to be decreased over a period of 300 years . Consequently
Radiance ' r ' replaces the velocity of light in the equations as everything is taking place in the
Medium of Prophet (P) .
</p>

<p>
	The solar system was created circa 4.54 Million years ago and made suitable for living things
to survive and flourish . Indeed , the size of universe is too big , the galaxy big , the solar system
small , the earth very small and the moon negligible . Owing to the fact that , ALLAH (S) created this
universe from the heat of Prophet , the splitting of the moon , no longer remains a miracle , as the
ordinary laser itself is capable of cutting any material . 
</p>

<p>
	Adam (A) and Hawwa (A) were living in the heavens by praying ALLAH (S) and sending
Daroods to Prophet (P) . The day when Adam (A) and Hawwa (A) obeyed the devil , they were
removed from heavens and sent to the earth along with Jin and Devil , circa 5202 B.H. 
</p>

<p>
	Birth is the WILL of ALLAH (S) [ Even a leaf will not flutter otherwise ] and the soul is the
authorization to utilize the bounties of ALLAH (S) in the medium of Prophet for a given period .
After completing the period , everything becomes useless and the body expires leaving the soul to
return to ALLAH (S) . The same soul is infused on the Day of Judgment – Insha ALLAH . 
</p>

<p>
	Adam (A) and Hawwa (A) met each other on Earth , married and as regards Mehr , on the
orders of ALLAH (S) , Adam (A) sent 20 Daroods to Prophet Muhammad (S) . Children were born
to them and established mankind on earth .
</p>

<p>
	ALLAH (S) created angels , only to worship , whereas mankind to live the life given and
worship ALLAH (S) . Consequently mankind was made superior to all the creations . Over a period
of time devil shown his presence and mankind was deviated from the purpose of creation . Since
ALLAH (S) loves the creation and as such , will send down Rasule ( Apostle ) and Nabi (Prophet) to
guide them to the right path . Rasules are those who are given new Shariath ( Code of Law ) ,
whereas Prophets are those who follow the Shariath of the previous Rasule . From Adam (A) to
Jesus (A) ; 1,24,000 Prophets and 313 Rasules were sent over a period of 5149 years . Of the 313
Rasules , the names of 25 are mentioned in the Holy Quran and 5 of them are referred as ' 
ULULAZM ' Rasules , including our last Prophet Muhammad (S) . 
</p>

<p>
Since Prophet Muhammad ( P ) is the First ( Awwal ) of the Creation , ALLAH (S) created the soul ,
Billions of years ago - and Last ( AAQIR ) to be sent , ALLAH (S) created the body of Sollam from
the body of Adam (A) and Muhammad ( S ) were born to Hazrath Abdulla and Bibi Aamina on
Monday the 12th Rabi I 53 B.H.
</p>
<p>
It is evident from the above that ; the heavens possess NOOR and the universe – its associate
heat , which has lower frequency than light . The higher frequency is attributed to souls of pure
bodies whereas lower frequencies to souls of impure bodies . The human bodies have frequencies
as their hearts beat 72 times in one minute having frequency – 72/60 = 1.2 Hz , which depends on
deeds . The Good deeds will harmonize the frequency and enhances the purity of bodies . Impure
bodies perish where as pure bodies survive even after secluding from this Universe .
</p>

<p>
<strong>“ ALLAH ( S.W.T ) is SUPREME , WHERAS <br>
MUHAMMAD ( S.A.W.S ) IS SUPREME , IN THE SIGHT OF ALLAH ( S.W.T ) ”</strong>
