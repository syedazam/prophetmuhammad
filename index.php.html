            <h2>Muhammad [PBUH] - THE SUPREME OF CREATION</h2>
			<p> ALLAH ( S.W.T ) created the very first creation – the sacred soul of Muhammad (PBUH) Billions
of years ago from THEIR own NOOR and Muhammad (P) worshipped ALLAH (S) and ALLAH (S)
sends Darood to THEIR QALEEL all the time . Then the angels were created to worship ALLAH (S)
and send Darood to THEIR Beloved . Later Adam (A.S), Hawwa (A.S ) , Jin , devil , heaven and hell
were created . The universe was created circa 13.8 Million years ago and solar system came into
existence circa 4.54 Million years ago . The day when Adam (A) and Hawwa (A) obeyed the devil ,
they were removed from heavens and sent to the earth along with Jin and devil circa 5202 BH ,
thus establishing mankind on earth . Over a period of time , devil proved his presence and
mankind was deviated from the right path , 313 Apostles (Rasules) and 1,24,000 Prophets
( Anbiya ) were sent over a period of 5,000 years to guide mankind</p>

			<p>
			In 53 BH , ALLAH (S) created – THE AAQIR - THE LAST (P) , from the Body of Adam (s) and 
Muhammad (P) were born on 12th Rabi I in the year of Elephant as the last Prophet . Though
Muhammad (P) is Apostle and prophet , but is the SUPREME in both the worlds – heavens and
universe . In Urdu , it is rightfully referred as Sarkar e do Jahan . The new generation should not
get confused with the title of Prophet , though a Prophet , but with a vast difference with the other
Rasules or Prophets . The other Apostles and Prophets are ONLY Apostles and Prophets whereas ,
Muhammad (P) is EVERYTHING after ALLAH (S) .
</p>

<p>
In fact ALLAH (S) created
</p><ul>
	<li>
		Everything by Muhammad (P)

	</li>
	<li>
		Everything to Muhammad (P)

	</li>
	<li>
		Everything for Muhammad (P)
	</li>
	
	
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
And further says 
<br>
<strong>“ Whoever obeys Muhammad (P) is like obeying ME (S) ”</strong>
</p>
<p>

When Muhammad (P) is everything , even followers of Muhammad (P) are highly privileged and
holds a special status and will be given salvation earlier to all the followers of other Prophets on
the day of Judgment - Insha ALLAH

</p>
<p>
All praise be to ALLAH (S) , exalted blessings as well as complete peace be on our Prophet (P) on whom ALLAH (S) sends Darood all the time , and their family and companions .
</p>
<p>
It is a well known fact that , ALLAH (S) possess ' NOOR ' (Light) . During Meraj (Ascension) , 
Prophet (P) visited all the seven heavens on Burraq , Raf Raf (Green throne) and a ' Circle of NOOR '
that took to Qaba Qosain ( The uppermost horizon) passing all the 70,000 curtains of NOOR and
met ALLAH (S) . Secondly when Musa (A.S) Pestered ALLAH (S) to show THEIR NOOR , a fraction
of it was shown and the consequence – Burnt Mountain SINAI at Egypt is preserved by ALLAH (S)
till the Dooms Day – Insha ALLAH .
</p>

Prophet (P) visited all the seven heavens on Burraq , Raf Raf (Green throne) and a ' Circle of NOOR '

of it was shown and the consequence – Burnt Mountain SINAI at Egypt is preserved by ALLAH (S)
till the Dooms Day – Insha ALLAH .
</p>

<p>
When ALLAH (S) thought of Creation , THEY started with the creation of THEIR BELOVED –
AHMED , QALEEL , HABEEB , SOLLAM , AMEEN , AWWAL (The First) (P) from THEIR own NOOR
without a body or form and Prophet worshipped for Billions of years . The angels were created
from the NOOR of Prophet to worship ALLAH (S) and to send Darood to THEIR beloved . ALLAH
(S) created the body of Adam (A) from the clay on which Prophet was worshipping and the NOOR
of Prophet was infused . Subsequently heaven , hell and Jin were created from the heat of Prophet .
Jin and Devil were created from fire . Adam (A) and Hawwa (A) lived happily in the heavens by
following the instructions and worshipping ALLAH (S) .

</p>

<p>
By the insight of ALLAH (S) , the Universe was created from the Heat associated with the
11 NOOR of Prophet , circa 13.8 Million years ago . The known Universe comprises of Billions (10 )
of Galaxies which are moving away from each other confirming its expansion . Each galaxy has
11 Billions (10 ) of stars and some stars are even bigger than the nearest star – sun . Nuclear
reactions take place in the sun producing Electromagnetic radiations , which comprises of
Radiant Heat Radiations and Light Radiations . The Light radiations or in short light facilitates
visibility , whereas Radiant Heat Radiations or in short Radiance is mandatory for living beings .
This Radiance constitutes a medium on the surface of earth . Similarly the Radiance due to
Billions of stars in Billions of galaxies produces the same Radiance in the entire universe . Since,
the universe itself is created from the heat of Prophet (P), the medium is called as ' MEDIUM OF
PROPHET (P) ', and Radiance is denoted by the symbol ' r ' - the title of Sollam (P) spiritually and
fire scientifically. The Radiance spreads with a constant velocity of 1,86,000 miles per second
unlike light , whose velocity was found to be decreased over a period of 300 years . Consequently
Radiance ' r ' replaces the velocity of light in the equations as everything is taking place in the
Medium of Prophet (P) .
</p>

<p>
	The solar system was created circa 4.54 Million years ago and made suitable for living things
to survive and flourish . Indeed , the size of universe is too big , the galaxy big , the solar system
small , the earth very small and the moon negligible . Owing to the fact that , ALLAH (S) created this
universe from the heat of Prophet , the splitting of the moon , no longer remains a miracle , as the
ordinary laser itself is capable of cutting any material . 
</p>

<p>
	Adam (A) and Hawwa (A) were living in the heavens by praying ALLAH (S) and sending
Daroods to Prophet (P) . The day when Adam (A) and Hawwa (A) obeyed the devil , they were
removed from heavens and sent to the earth along with Jin and Devil , circa 5202 B.H. 
</p>

<p>
	Birth is the WILL of ALLAH (S) [ Even a leaf will not flutter otherwise ] and the soul is the
authorization to utilize the bounties of ALLAH (S) in the medium of Prophet for a given period .
After completing the period , everything becomes useless and the body expires leaving the soul to
return to ALLAH (S) . The same soul is infused on the Day of Judgment – Insha ALLAH . 
</p>

<p>
	Adam (A) and Hawwa (A) met each other on Earth , married and as regards Mehr , on the
orders of ALLAH (S) , Adam (A) sent 20 Daroods to Prophet Muhammad (S) . Children were born
to them and established mankind on earth .
</p>

<p>
	ALLAH (S) created angels , only to worship , whereas mankind to live the life given and
worship ALLAH (S) . Consequently mankind was made superior to all the creations . Over a period
of time devil shown his presence and mankind was deviated from the purpose of creation . Since
ALLAH (S) loves the creation and as such , will send down Rasule ( Apostle ) and Nabi (Prophet) to
guide them to the right path . Rasules are those who are given new Shariath ( Code of Law ) ,
whereas Prophets are those who follow the Shariath of the previous Rasule . From Adam (A) to
Jesus (A) ; 1,24,000 Prophets and 313 Rasules were sent over a period of 5149 years . Of the 313
Rasules , the names of 25 are mentioned in the Holy Quran and 5 of them are referred as ' 
ULULAZM ' Rasules , including our last Prophet Muhammad (S) . 
</p>

<p>
Since Prophet Muhammad ( P ) is the First ( Awwal ) of the Creation , ALLAH (S) created the soul ,
Billions of years ago - and Last ( AAQIR ) to be sent , ALLAH (S) created the body of Sollam from
the body of Adam (A) and Muhammad ( S ) were born to Hazrath Abdulla and Bibi Aamina on
Monday the 12th Rabi I 53 B.H.
</p>
<p>
It is evident from the above that ; the heavens possess NOOR and the universe – its associate
heat , which has lower frequency than light . The higher frequency is attributed to souls of pure
bodies whereas lower frequencies to souls of impure bodies . The human bodies have frequencies
as their hearts beat 72 times in one minute having frequency – 72/60 = 1.2 Hz , which depends on
deeds . The Good deeds will harmonize the frequency and enhances the purity of bodies . Impure
bodies perish where as pure bodies survive even after secluding from this Universe .
</p>

<p>
<strong>“ ALLAH ( S.W.T ) is SUPREME , WHERAS <br>
MUHAMMAD ( S.A.W.S ) IS SUPREME , IN THE SIGHT OF ALLAH ( S.W.T ) ”</strong>

	<div class="contentsub">
		
		<h2>Creation of the World</h2>
			<p> Justifying the Creator to some extent can be done atleast by trying to understand the existing creation . The earth on which we live is like a sphere of radius 6000 kms and circumference 40,000
kms , which is rotating and revolving round the Sun . After imagining a sphere of circumference
40,000 kms , now imagine three lakh such spheres which are combined to form a single sphere ,
this single sphere constitutes our Sun . The Sun is at a distance of 15 crore kms and has a
temperature of 2 cr degree . The highest known speed is the speed of Radiance ' r ' which is 3 lakh
km / sec . In other words , it travels a distance of 3 lakh kms in one second . The light from Sun takes
8.3 minutes to reach the Earth . The Sun rotates about its axis and the earth along with the other
six planets revolve round the Sun which constitutes our Solar System . </p>

			<p>
However big is our solar system , but occupies a very small place in our galaxy ' Milky Way '.
18 The diameter of our galaxy is 10 kms . In others words , 100 crore makes 1 Billion . Now imagine
1 Billion kilometers , where each kilometer represents 1 Billion Kilometers , then this will be the
16 41 diameter of our galaxy . The Central thickness is 6 x 10 kilometers and weight 3x10 kg .
11 The galaxy has 10 stars , in other words , ten lakh stars where each star represents 1 lakh stars .
15 Sun is a star and some stars are even bigger than Sun . At a distance of 28x10 Sun is a star and
15 some stars are even bigger than Sun . At a distance of 28x10 kilometres from the centre of galaxy
, our solar system is situated . The Milky Way is rotating about its axis at the speed of 250 km / sec
and takes 250 million years to complete one revolution . Apart from this , our galaxy is moving .
11 Like Milky Way , 10 galaxies are discovered till date , which are of different sizes and some are
even bigger than our galaxy . All the galaxies are moving and the distance of the farthest galaxy is
22 at a distance of 3x10 km from earth . In other words , this Universe is expanding .
</p>

<p>
Scientifically speaking the matter , energy and space that exists , including all the 10
11 galaxies and each galaxy having 10 stars which are rotating and moving is known as ' Universe '.
The Universe began in a Big Bang about 13.8 billion years ago and may survive for another 3.6
billion years . The Universe discovered by mankind by using the self made devices such as high
resolution Telescopes etc., comprises a part of the Universe . The remaining is YET to be
discovered . Apart from our Universe , there are probabilities of existing Multiverse .
</p>
<p>


After imagining the size of the creation , one will definitely feel that the size of galaxies small ,
the size our galaxy very small , the size of our solar system very very small , the size of our earthnegligible
and the size of our Saints / Messengers / Avatars , of course so negligible which cannot
be imagined . Secondly , after knowing the unimaginable might , one cannot compare the Saints /
Messengers / Avatars with the Creator and cannot apply the same analogy of living beings who
have family , children etc. , as an ant however powerful is , will belong to ant species and not any
other powerful species . The Creator of unimaginable might has no family members who are
negligible like us . Consequently the Creator neither has family nor any son . The Creator sent the
Saints / Messengers / Avatars to preach the mankind about the good and evil .
</p>
<p>

The Saints / Messengers / Avatars successfully completed their mission and hence they deserve
to be respected . Owing to ignorance and reverence , the mankind apart from respecting , started
praying the Saints / Messengers / Avatars . In fact the Creator of the unimaginable might , who
created Saints / Messengers / Avatars and everything , must be prayed and the Saints /
Messengers / Avatars must be revered
</p>
<p>
After creating Universe , the Creator made the things suitable for mankind to survive ( before
the existence of mankind ) by providing oxygen , water, temperature by keeping the proper
distance between Sun and Earth , the rotation of the earth to have days and nights , the revolving of
earth to have all four seasons , forests , animals , agriculture for food etc. After providing all the
facilities , the Creator infused intelligence in the brains of mankind to distinguish between good
and bad and to understand and pray the Creator for having showered the bounties on mankind .
To keep the mankind in the right path , the Creator showed the right path by sending Saints /
Messengers / Avatars after according extraordinary powers to them in the form of human beings ,
so that they can live with us and preach to be thankful by worshipping the Creator .
</p>
<p>

Since the existence of mankind , the mankind was not aware of the Might and assumed that ,
the creation consists only of earth , sun and stars and because of innocence and ignorance started
praying the Saints / Messengers / Avatars who were like us , by assuming them as Creator . But
now it is evident that , the size of the Universe is unimaginable and the imagination of Creation is
almost next to impossible . Consequently there is Creator or One God of unimaginable might , who has no family or son and all must pray in return of the bounties showered on us

	  <h2>World Eternal Calendar </h2>
			<p> It is a very well known fact that , though mankind has progressed in all walks of life yet , failed
to find the exact dates of the previous centuries in pre common or post common era .
Consequently , the exact dates of the important events in the world could not be found . In fact the
quest to find the exact Date of Birth of the “ Last Messenger of GOD ” caused the beginning of my
research and as a sequel , I took up the research on the before common era . In this direction , an
attempt has been made by me to formulate a calendar , which provides the exact dates from Time
Immemorial to Eternity .
</p>

			<p>
In my 60 years of life , I have dedicated seven years in the formulation of the calendar , which
shows the exact dates from 01.01.0001 C E till date and extended it till eternity , for which even
the internet bears testimony . In addition to this I have formulated the exact dates of the pre
common era from 01.01.0001 BCE to Time Immemorial , thus creating the Calendar to exhibit all
the years of existence and future .

</p>

<p>
The authenticity and collateral proof of this calendar is evident from my contemporary ,
Mathematician Steve Dinh (USA) , who has proved 01.01.0001 C.E as Monday by Mathematical
calculations which is available on the link http:/www.searchfor/ancestors/utility/dayofweekhtml
. My calendar bears testimony with his calculation of days between 01.01.0001 CE and
31.12.2015 C E as 7,35,963 .

</p>
<p>


I am very glad to say that , the reliability and validity factors of the newly formulated
calendar were found out to be consistent and immaculate . It is named as ' WORLD ETERNAL
CALENDAR ' or in short “ AMEEN CALENDAR ”.

</p>
<p>

The very first application is obviously about the date of birth of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) ,
w nd hich I found was Monday the 22 April 571 CE .
