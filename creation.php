            <h2>Muhammad - The Cause of Creation</h2>
			<p> Justifying the Creator to some extent can be done atleast by trying to understand the existing creation . The earth on which we live is like a sphere of radius 6000 kms and circumference 40,000
kms , which is rotating and revolving round the Sun . After imagining a sphere of circumference
40,000 kms , now imagine three lakh such spheres which are combined to form a single sphere ,
this single sphere constitutes our Sun . The Sun is at a distance of 15 crore kms and has a
temperature of 2 cr degree . The highest known speed is the speed of Radiance ' r ' which is 3 lakh
km / sec . In other words , it travels a distance of 3 lakh kms in one second . The light from Sun takes
8.3 minutes to reach the Earth . The Sun rotates about its axis and the earth along with the other
six planets revolve round the Sun which constitutes our Solar System . </p>

			<p>
However big is our solar system , but occupies a very small place in our galaxy ' Milky Way '.
18 The diameter of our galaxy is 10 kms . In others words , 100 crore makes 1 Billion . Now imagine
1 Billion kilometers , where each kilometer represents 1 Billion Kilometers , then this will be the
16 41 diameter of our galaxy . The Central thickness is 6 x 10 kilometers and weight 3x10 kg .
11 The galaxy has 10 stars , in other words , ten lakh stars where each star represents 1 lakh stars .
15 Sun is a star and some stars are even bigger than Sun . At a distance of 28x10 Sun is a star and
15 some stars are even bigger than Sun . At a distance of 28x10 kilometres from the centre of galaxy
, our solar system is situated . The Milky Way is rotating about its axis at the speed of 250 km / sec
and takes 250 million years to complete one revolution . Apart from this , our galaxy is moving .
11 Like Milky Way , 10 galaxies are discovered till date , which are of different sizes and some are
even bigger than our galaxy . All the galaxies are moving and the distance of the farthest galaxy is
22 at a distance of 3x10 km from earth . In other words , this Universe is expanding .
</p>

<p>
Scientifically speaking the matter , energy and space that exists , including all the 10
11 galaxies and each galaxy having 10 stars which are rotating and moving is known as ' Universe '.
The Universe began in a Big Bang about 13.8 billion years ago and may survive for another 3.6
billion years . The Universe discovered by mankind by using the self made devices such as high
resolution Telescopes etc., comprises a part of the Universe . The remaining is YET to be
discovered . Apart from our Universe , there are probabilities of existing Multiverse .
</p>
<p>


After imagining the size of the creation , one will definitely feel that the size of galaxies small ,
the size our galaxy very small , the size of our solar system very very small , the size of our earthnegligible
and the size of our Saints / Messengers / Avatars , of course so negligible which cannot
be imagined . Secondly , after knowing the unimaginable might , one cannot compare the Saints /
Messengers / Avatars with the Creator and cannot apply the same analogy of living beings who
have family , children etc. , as an ant however powerful is , will belong to ant species and not any
other powerful species . The Creator of unimaginable might has no family members who are
negligible like us . Consequently the Creator neither has family nor any son . The Creator sent the
Saints / Messengers / Avatars to preach the mankind about the good and evil .
</p>
<p>

The Saints / Messengers / Avatars successfully completed their mission and hence they deserve
to be respected . Owing to ignorance and reverence , the mankind apart from respecting , started
praying the Saints / Messengers / Avatars . In fact the Creator of the unimaginable might , who
created Saints / Messengers / Avatars and everything , must be prayed and the Saints /
Messengers / Avatars must be revered
</p>
<p>
After creating Universe , the Creator made the things suitable for mankind to survive ( before
the existence of mankind ) by providing oxygen , water, temperature by keeping the proper
distance between Sun and Earth , the rotation of the earth to have days and nights , the revolving of
earth to have all four seasons , forests , animals , agriculture for food etc. After providing all the
facilities , the Creator infused intelligence in the brains of mankind to distinguish between good
and bad and to understand and pray the Creator for having showered the bounties on mankind .
To keep the mankind in the right path , the Creator showed the right path by sending Saints /
Messengers / Avatars after according extraordinary powers to them in the form of human beings ,
so that they can live with us and preach to be thankful by worshipping the Creator .
</p>
<p>

Since the existence of mankind , the mankind was not aware of the Might and assumed that ,
the creation consists only of earth , sun and stars and because of innocence and ignorance started
praying the Saints / Messengers / Avatars who were like us , by assuming them as Creator . But
now it is evident that , the size of the Universe is unimaginable and the imagination of Creation is
almost next to impossible . Consequently there is Creator or One God of unimaginable might , who has no family or son and all must pray in return of the bounties showered on us
