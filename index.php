				     It is evident from PROPHET MUHAMMAD [P] that, ALLAH [SWT] posses NOOR, which consists of DIVINE LIGHT of unimaginable intensity. And it is confirmed from the incidence of Musa [A.S] that, when he pestered ALLAH [S] to show THEIR NOOR, a fraction of it was shown and the consequence – burnt mountain Tur [Mount Sinai] at Egypt is preserved till date and will be, till the Doomsday – Insha ALLAH.
			</p>	

			<p>
				     When ALLAH [S] thought of creation, THEY created, the Sacred Soul of PROPHET MUHAMMAD [P] - THE AWWAL [FIRST], THE BELOVED and HABEEB from THEIR OWN NOOR and the SOUL of PROPHET [P] worshiped for billions of years. ALLAH [S] then decided to create the other creations “FOR MUHAMMAD AND FROM MUHAMMAD [P]”.  All the creations were created from the NOOR of PROPHET [P], since NOOR is DIVINE and comprises of both heat and light, some are created from DIVINE LIGHT and the rest from DIVINE HEAT.
			</p>
			
			<p>
					    The very first creation after MUHAMMAD [P] was 'PEN' and ALLAH [S] ordered it, to write everything on a Board, each and every event that will take place from the beginning till the Doomsday. The Pen wrote all the things and is preserved forever [Looh a Mahfooz].
			</p>
			
			<p>
     			The angels were created from the DIVINE NOOR of MUHAMMAD [P]. The body of Adam [AS] was created from the clay on which the SOUL of PROPHET [P] was worshiping and DIVINE NOOR of MUHAMMAD [P] was infused. Hawwa [AS] was created by taking the clay from the rib of Adam [AS] and DIVINE NOOR of PROPHET [P] was infused. Jin, Heaven and Hell were created from the DIVINE HEAT of MUHAMMAD [P], whereas Devil is created from Fire.
			</p>
			
			<p>
     The Universe was created from “THE DIVINE HEAT OF PROPHET {P}” circa 13.82 billion years ago. And ALLAH [S] mentions in Sura Fussilath [41] 
and Verse 11 that;
			</p>
			
			<p>
     “THEN HE DIRECTED HIMSELF TO THE HEAVEN WHILE IT WAS ‘SMOKE’ AND SAID TO IT AND TO THE EARTH, COME [INTO BEING] WILLINGLY OR BY COMPULSION, THEY SAID, WE HAVE COME WILLINGLY” 
			</p>
			
			<p>
     In other words, the Universe was created from SMOKE / FIRE / HEAT.
			</p>
			
			<p>
     Scientifically, the Universe was something, an infinitesimally small, infinitely hot and infinitely dense called ‘Singularity’ consisting of Neutrons, Protons and Electrons [Fundamental Particles]. ‘SOMEHOW’, it apparently inflated and expanded with a bang called ‘Big Bang’ and cooled. Over time, the electrons met up with protons as well as neutrons and created atoms forming the Universe [Hydrogen atom to the Galaxies]. Though the scientists are aware of the fact that, inflation takes place ONLY in the presence of temperature of the order of 10 billion0C, they fail to explain the source of temperature and used the word ‘HOWEVER’. Obviously, it was the HEAT of PROPHET [P].  
			</p>
			
			<p>
     The Universe is not only created from the Heat of  MUHAMMAD [P], but it is MANDATORY for its existence. For instance, in an atom the electrons are orbiting the nucleus consisting of protons and neutrons. When heated, the electrons jump from lower orbit to higher orbit and when cooled, they jump from higher orbit to lower orbit. If the atom is further cooled to the lowest possible, the electron will never jump to the nucleus [If at all they jump to the nucleus, the atom ceases to be atom and the Universe will collapse]. This clearly indicates the presence of Heat and obviously it is the HEAT OF MUHAMMAD [P] WHICH IS PREVALENT IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
     To establish mankind in the Universe, ALLAH [S] created the EARTH AT THE CENTRE OF UNIVERSE along with sun, planets and moons circa 4.54 billion years ago. The location  of   Kaaba, was selected in such a way that it satisfies the ratio 1:1.618, known as DIVINE RATIO or Golden Ratio  
[The proportion of distance between Makkah and North Pole to the distance between Makkah and South Pole is 1.618]. Even the Noble Quran and Nature including the proportions of our own body parts bear testimony with this [The length from head to navel is 1 and navel to foot is 1.618]. In fact, ALLAH [S] has selected the Divine Mean Point of the earth as the place of HIS HOUSE as HE [S] does 'EVERYTHING BY MEASURE'   [Sura 13, Ar Ra'd, Verse 8] 
(Photos on Page No. 16 and 18). In fact;

<strong>“HOLY KAABA IS THE CENTRE OF UNIVERSE”</strong>
			</p>
			
			<p>
     Of late, I have proved that, Heat is present in the entire Universe. According to my theory, the Universe comprises of billions [1011] of Galaxies, which are moving away and each galaxy has billions [1011] of Stars. Fusion reaction takes place in all the stars of all the galaxies and enormous amount of heat and light energy is generated. And the energy produced is received by the surrounding heavenly bodies. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
     Similar fusion reaction takes place in the sun and heat as well as light energy is received by the earth. To remove the heat energy, the temperature was reduced to the least possible – the Absolute Zero   [-273.150 C] and found that, it is still present, which is obviously the DIVINE HEAT of PROPHET MUHAMMAD [P]. Our team of Physicists, tried our best to remove this Heat, but failed to succeed. This Divine Heat of PROPHET [P] was found to be prevalent in the entire Universe forming a UNIVERSAL MEDIUM known as PROPHET'S MEDIUM OR “RADIANCE”. And it was found to be MANDATORY for the survival, not only for atoms but also for CELLS, otherwise mankind would have never existed. Scientifically, the DIVINE HEAT is named as 'Zero Point Heat Energy or in short Zero Point Energy' Consequently;  
			</p>
			
			<p>
<strong>“ WE ARE SURVIVING IN THE MEDIUM OF PROPHET MUHAMMAD [P] CALLED RADIANCE ”</strong>
			</p>
			
			<p>
     The Divine Heat or the Zero Point Energy is MANDATORY, not only for the existence of Universe, but also for the SURVIVAL OF LIVING THINGS. For instance, the human body which is made up of cells has normal body temperature of 370C and reduces to 260C during worst health conditions [Human temperature varies between 260 and 440C]. The temperature never reduces further for human beings. It reduces only after 'DEATH' [Dead bodies become cold]. In other words, the Divine Heat is maintaining the required temperature for survival.
			</p>
			
			<p>
     “THE HEAT WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE TO REMOVE FROM THE UNIVERSE AND IS MANDATORY FOR ITS SURVIVAL IS KNOWN AS MUHAMMAD'S DIVINE HEAT [P] AND ITS SPEED IS 3,00,000 KM / SEC. THIS IS, THE MAXIMUM KNOWN SPEED IN THE UNIVERSE AND NOT THE SPEED OF LIGHT, AS ACCEPTED BY THE SCIENTISTS WORLD OVER. THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT NO LONGER REMAINS 
A CONSTANT AND HAS REDUCED FROM THE LAST 400 YEARS”
			</p>
			
			<p>
     In other words, MUHAMMAD [P] is the source of heat for the creation of Universe and its survival. This was demonstrated by PROPHET [P] by splitting the moon to convince the pagan Meccans [Heat created by us can split even metal]. Of late, it is confirmed by the photographs of moon that, a rift line is existing across its surface  – SUBHAN ALLAH (Photo on Page No. 12).
			</p>
			
			<p>
     It is evident that, ALLAH [S] has accorded Super Natural powers to MUHAMMAD [P] and hidden some secrets of HIS love. The discovery of PROPHET'S name “MUHAMMAD IN ARABIC” on the fourth planet Mars, bears testimony to this (Photo on Page No. 20).
			</p>
			
			<p>
     After creating the Universe, earth along with solar system and making it suitable for living beings, ALLAH [S] sent Jin to the earth About 7000 BH years ago. After flourishing they got indulged in destruction, murder and deviated from the right path. ALLAH [S] ordered the angels to destroy them. A group of angels came to the earth and threw them into the mountains after crushing them.
			</p>
			
			<p>
    The day when Adam [AS] and Hawwa [AS] obeyed the devil, they were removed from heavens and sent to the earth along with jin as well as devil circa 5202 BH. Adam [AS] prayed for hundreds of years to forgive his sin. Only after taking Waseela of MUHAMMAD [P], the prayer was accepted in the 300th year. Adam [AS] along with Hawwa [AS] established mankind and were praying ALLAH [S] – MONOTHEISM. Over a period of time, devil proved his presence and mankind was deviated from the right path and got indulged in POLYTHEISM.  ALLAH [S] being MERCIFUL, sent 313 Apostles [Rasools] and 1,24,000 Prophets [Messengers] to guide mankind.    
			</p>
			
			<p>
     Human Beings who have body and weight are called 'Material Bodies', if they do not have weight but only bodies are called 'Non Material Bodies'. Living Bodies have Divine Heat in their bodies during their life time. The removal of Divine Heat in them results in 'DEATH'. It is but true that, Heavens posses Divine Noor and Universe posses Divine Heat. In the Heavens, there are angels, whereas in the Universe [earth], there were Prophets, Messengers, Saints, Jin as well as Human Beings and at present there are Saints, jin and Human Beings.
			</p>
			
			<p>
     Angels are Super Natural Beings having Divine Light and Nonmaterial Bodies, whereas others are Natural Beings having Divine Heat and material bodies like us. The nonmaterial bodies posses Divine Light Energy and material bodies posses Divine Heat Energy. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
Prophets / Saints have Divine Heat Energy as well as Divine Light Energy and become Super Natural Beings and perform like angels during their life time. After leaving this world, they will not have Divine Heat Energy but only Divine Light Energy and become Super Natural Beings and behave like Angels. After the death of Natural Beings [we], our bodies are preserved till the Doomsday and Divine Light Energy is accorded on the Judgment Day and our DEAR PROPHET [P] will recommend for SALVATION – Insha ALLAH.
			</p>
			
			<p>
     During the creation of Heavens, Universe, Solar System as well as establishing mankind and sending all Prophets / Messengers, the SOUL of MUHAMMAD [P] was worshiping the ALMIGHTY in Heavens. As ALLAH [S] had decided to send MUHAMMAD [P] as the LAST PROPHET [THE AAQIR], HE [S] created the BODY from the body of Adam [AS] and MUHAMMAD [P] was born on 12th Rabi I in the year of elephant as the last PROPHET. [12th day is the best in the lunar month, the best season of the year spring, fell in the month of Rabi I and the year was Historical in which ALLAH [S] saved HIS HOUSE KAABA.]. On the 40th Birthday, ALLAH [S] accorded Prophethood, which took place on Friday the 12th Rabi I 13 BH at Makkah.
			</p>
			
			<p>
     Gibrael [AS] once informed PROPHET [P] that, after thousands of years of prayers, ALLAH [S] shown me the NOOR of ARSH and I saw the following words;
			</p>
			
			<p>
<strong>“LA ILAHA ILLALLA, MUHAMMAD AR RASOOL ALLAH”</strong>
<br/>I asked ALLAH [S], ' WHO IS MUHAMMAD '
			</p>
			
			<p>
     ALLAH [S] replied, IF MUHAMMAD WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THERE, I WOULD NOT HAVE CREATED YOU, NEITHER HEAVEN, HELL NOR SUN AND MOON.
     <br/>
           And then ordered me to send Darood.
			</p>
			
			<p>
     Once PROPHET [P] performed a very long prostration, for having asked, THEY [P] replied, Gibrael [AS] has delivered good news to ME [P] that, “WHOEVER SEND DAROOD TO ME, THEN ALLAH WILL BLESS THEM AND THOSE WHO SEND SALAM TO ME, THEN ALLAH WILL GIVE REPLY” – SUBHAN ALLAH.
			</p>
			
			<p>
     In the 12th year of Prophethood, ALLAH [S] wanted to meet the BELOVED MUHAMMAD [P] and show HIS signs. HE [S] ordered Gibrael [AS] to take the Buraq from Heavens and bring THE DEAREST. Gibrael [AS] reached Holy Kaaba and made the Body of PROPHET [P] suitable to MEET ALLAH [S] by cutting open the throat, down to a part below the heart till he emptied the chest and stomach. After cleaning the stomach with Zamzam water, the “GOLDEN LIGHT” which was brought from Heavens was poured inside and closed the opened part.
			</p>
			
			<p>
     The name of conveyance 'BURAQ', was derived from the Arabic word 'Barq', which means electricity or electric current. And the speed of current is the speed of Heat or Light [Lightning] which is 3,00,000 km / sec. In other words, the Buraaq covers a distance of 3,00,000 km every second.
			</p>
			
			<p>
     MUHAMMAD [P] along with Gibrael [AS] started the PRIVILEGED JOURNEY called 'ISRA' from Masjid al Haram to Masjid al Aqsa on Buraq with the lightning speed and reached in 0.003 sec  [The distance between Makkah and Bait Al Muqaddas is 1232 km / 765 miles / 665 nautical miles]. All the earlier PROPHETS had gathered for the Special Occasion and offered prayers led by MUHAMMAD [P]. MUHAMMAD [P] praised ALLAH [S] and addressed them.
			</p>
			
			<p>
ALLAH [S] mentions in Sura Al Isra / Bani Israel [17] and verse [01] that;
			</p>
			
			<p>
     “EXALTED IS HE, WHO TOOK HIS SERVANT BY NIGHT FROM 
AL MASJID AL HARAM TO AL MASJID AL AQSA, WHOSE SURROUNDINGS WE HAVE BLESSED, TO SHOW HIM OUR SIGNS, INDEED HE IS THE HEARING, SEEING”
			</p>
			
			<p>
     The PRIVILEGED JOURNEY [MERAJ OR ASCENSION] continued towards Heavens and PROPHET [P] met Adam [AS], Isa [AS], Yousuf [AS], Idrees [AS], Haroon [AS], Moosa [AS] and Ibraheem [AS] in First, Second up to Seventh Heaven respectively. After visiting BAIT AL MA'MOOR [which is exactly above Holy KAABA], Heaven and Hell, PROPHET [P] reached SIDRAT AL MUNTAHA. When the Journey beyond SIDRAT AL MUNTAHA began, Gibrael [AS] stopped at a place and MUHAMMAD [P] continued. ALLAH [S] sent a GREEN THRONE 'RAFRAF' and PROPHET [P] covered a distance. At a place, Rafraf stopped and a 'CIRCLE OF NOOR' was brought as ride. MUHAMMAD [P] passed through 70,000 curtains of NOOR and reached “ARSH” [THE LIMIT OF HIGHNESS].
			</p>
			
			<p>
<strong>Then ALLAH [S] brought MUHAMMAD [P] closer and said;</strong>
<br/>
<strong>'MY BELOVED, REVEAL WHATEVER YOU WANTED'</strong>
			</p>
			
			<p>
     MUHAMMAD [P] saw the NOOR of ALLAH [S] from a closer distance [Qaba Qosain or two bow lengths] and ALLAH [S] REVEALED, WHATEVER HAD TO REVEAL. PROPHET [P] convinced ALLAH [S] for ONLY 5 time prayer a day and returned to Makkah. The people of Makkah and in particular Hazrat Abuzar asked;
			</p>
			
			<p>
“DID YOU SEE ALLAH [S]”, 
FOR WHICH MUHAMMAD [P] REPLIED                                         
“HOW CAN I SEE - HE IS NOOR”
			</p>
			
			<p>
ALLAH [S] narrates the observations made by PROPHET [P] during 
Meraj in Sura An Najm [54], Verses 7 and 8, that;
			</p>
			
			<p>
     “HE STOOD POISED IN FRONT WHEN HE WAS ON THE UPPERMOST HORIZON. THEN HE DREW NEAR AND HUNG SUSPENDED ABOVE, TWO BOW LENGTHS AWAY OR EVEN CLOSER. THEN HE REVEALED TO THE SERVANT OF ALLAH WHATEVER HE HAD TO REVEAL”
			</p>
			
			<p>
     MUHAMMAD [P] SAW ALLAH [S] again while descending at SIDRAT AL MUNTAHA which is mentioned in Sura An Najm [54] and verses 11 to 14, that;
			</p>
			
			<p>
     “AND HE SAW HIM ONCE AGAIN BY THE FARTHEST LOTE TREE, NEARBY WHICH IS THE GARDEN OF REPOSE. AT THAT TIME THE LOTE TREE WAS COVERED WITH THAT WHICH COVERED IT. THE SIGHT WAS NEITHER DAZZLED NOR IT EXCEEDED THE LIMIT, AND HE SAW THE GREATEST SIGNS OF HIS CREATOR”
			</p>
			
			<p>
     In the seventh heaven, PROPHET [P] was shown BAIT AL MA'MUR – THE HOUSE OF ALLAH made for angels to pray and circumambulate. It is situated exactly above our Kaaba, wherein 70,000 angels enter every day and will not return, as fresh batch of 70,000 will perform the next day. And this will continue till Doomsday – Insha ALLAH.

     Since the earth along with Kaaba is rotating as well as revolving and Bait al Ma'mur is exactly above Kaaba all the times, obviously Bait al Ma'mur is also rotating. And ALLAH [S] mentions in Sura [17] Al Isra and verse 60, that;
			</p>
			
			<p>
			<strong>“ INDEED YOUR ALMIGHTY HAS ENCOMPASSED THE PEOPLE ” </strong>

			It is self explanatory that,
			</p>
			
			<p>"ALLAH [S] OR HIS NOOR IS ENCOMPASSING THE WHOLE UNIVERSE ALONG WITH THE HEAVENS" </p>
			
			<p>
     Truly, the name of MUHAMMAD [P] is synonymous with Creation or the Universe, Consequently an event of PROPHET [P] could be celebrated as 'UNIVERSE DAY'. There is no other Holy event, bigger than the Date of Birth. We are celebrating the lunar Date of Birth as Milad un Nabi, whereas the Solar Date of Birth could be celebrated as UNIVERSE DAY. As a result of this, the younger generation will understand the STATUS OF MUHAMMAD [P], else they may regard HIM, only as  a  PROPHET [P].

     “THOUGH MUHAMMAD [P] IS A PROPHET, BUT IS 'EVERYTHING'  AFTER ALLAH [S]” -  SUBHAN ALLAH 
			</p>
			
			<p>
     According to the 'WORLD ETERNAL CALENDAR' formulated by me, exclusively  to find  the Solar  Date  of  Birth of  MUHAMMAD [P], the Lunar  Date  of  Birth, Monday  the 12th  Rabi  I  53  BH,                                                                               corresponds to Monday  the 22nd  April  571 CE as the  Solar  Date of  Birth. The Lunar  Date  of  Birth of MUHAMMAD [S.A.W.SOLLAM]  is celebrated as  “MILAD UN NABI”, whereas  the Solar  Date  of Birth could be celebrated as “UNIVERSE DAY”.
